# Lemon-Thyme Sheet-Pan Chicken and Potatoes

* Yields: **4-6** servings
* Prep Time: **0** hours **15** minutes
* Total Time: **1** hour **5** minutes

## Ingredients

* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1 1/2 teaspoon rough chopped fresh thyme
* 4 garlic cloves, chopped
* Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon, plus 1 lemon cut into wedges
* 3 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
* 10 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (4 to 4 1/2 lbs.)
* 2 lbs. red potatoes (6 medium) cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 tablespoon finely chopped fresh parsley

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°. Whisk the olive oil, thyme, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
2. Add the chicken, potatoes, and lemon wedges to the bowl. Toss well.
3. Dump the mixture onto a rimmed baking sheet. Turn the chicken skin-side up and space the pieces evenly apart.
4. Roast on the middle oven rack, rotating the pan halfway through, until the chicken is golden brown and registers 165° on an instant-read thermometer, about 50 minutes. Remove to a platter and sprinkle with the parsley. Drizzle with any juices from the baking sheet and squeeze the roasted lemon wedges on the chicken.
