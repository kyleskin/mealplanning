* Yields: **6-8** servings
* Prep Time: **15** minutes
* Total Time: **3** hours **15** minutes

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, *optional*
* 1/2 teaspoon chopped, fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish
* 2 tablespoon vegetable oil
* 1 tablespoon butter
* 8 1-inch thick boneless pork loin chops (about 3 lbs.)
* 1 large onion, sliced
* 1 10.75 ounce can cream of mushroom soup
* 1 1/4 cup chick broth
* 3 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* Cooked egg noodles or mashed potatoes, for serving

## Directions

1. In a pie plate, whisk together the flour, salt, pepper, cayenne, and thyme leaves. Dredge each side of the pork chops in the flour mixture, then set aside on a plate
2. Heat the oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops to the pan (work in two batches if needed) and cook for 3 minutes on each side. Remove them to a plate.
3. Add the onions to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes, until lightly golden and slightly softened. Remove from the heat.
4. Add the cream of mushroom soup, chicken broth, and Worcestershire sauce to the base of 6- to 8- quart slow cooker. Whisk everything together to combine. Add the onions and thyme sprigs, then nestle the pork chops into the broth mixture. Cover and cook over high heat for 1 hour, then reduce to low heat for 3 more hours, until tender. Serve the pork chops with some of the gravy, onions, and a sprinkle of fresh thyme leaves, over cooked egg noodles or mashed potatoes, if you like.
